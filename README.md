# Business Card Website

## Description
This project is a static business card site that serves as an online CV. It is developed using HTML and CSS for layout and styling, as well as JavaScript for implementing interactive elements such as buttons and navigation. The project focuses on simplicity and ease of use, without integrating complex builders like Webpack.

## System Requirements
To run the project, you will need:
- Any modern web browser (Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Safari, Edge, etc.).
- A local server, for example, Live Server via VSCode or similar, for correct operation and file delivery.

## Deployment Instructions
Clone the project repository to your local computer, use an extension such as Live Server to launch a local server. Open the site in a browser.

## Future Development Plans
In the future, I plan to transform this project into a full-fledged portfolio website. This will include:
- Adding a section with projects demonstrating my skills and experience.
- Integrating a feedback form for convenient communication.
- Expanding JavaScript functionality to enhance the user interface.
